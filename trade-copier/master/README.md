## How to Run

1. **Configure your broker credentials** (first time only):
   ```bash
   cd trade-copier/master
   python launcher.py
   ```
   The GUI will prompt you to enter:
   - Broker username/email
   - API token

2. **Launch the dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python launcher.py
   ```

## Configuration

The launcher automatically generates a `config.json` file with your settings:
```json
{
  "api_url": "https://quotrading-flask-api.azurewebsites.net",
  "master_key": "<auto-generated>",
  "account_type": "Prop Firm",
  "broker_name": "TopStep",
  "broker": {
    "username": "your_email@gmail.com",
    "api_token": "your_api_token"
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `master_key` is automatically generated from your broker credentials for API authentication. You don't need to manually configure it.

## Features Previously in Cloud Admin Dashboard

All features from the cloud-based admin dashboard (`cloud-api/flask-api/admin-dashboard-full.html`) are now available in this local GUI:

- ✅ User management (suspend, activate, extend)
- ✅ Real-time zones monitoring
- ✅ System health checks
- ✅ Trade copy monitoring
- ✅ Live follower tracking

## Benefits of Unified Dashboard

1. **Single Application** - No need to run separate admin dashboard in cloud
2. **Faster Access** - Local GUI is more responsive than web interface
3. **Integrated Workflow** - Manage users and monitor trades in one place
4. **Secure** - Admin features run locally, not exposed via web
5. **Offline Capable** - Most features work without internet connection

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab Navigation** - Switch between tabs
- **F5** - Refresh current view
- **Ctrl+Q** - Quit application

## Troubleshooting

### Can't see admin features?
- Ensure you have valid admin credentials configured
- The `master_key` in config.json must be valid

### Zones tab shows "No zones"?
- Check that TradingView alerts are configured
- Verify webhook URL points to your API server
- Check zones API endpoint is accessible

### Health tab shows unhealthy services?
- Verify internet connection
- Check API server is running
- Ensure database credentials are correct

## Migration from Cloud Admin Dashboard

The cloud admin dashboard at `/admin-dashboard-full.html` is deprecated in favor of this unified local dashboard. All functionality has been migrated to this local GUI application.

To use this instead of the cloud dashboard:
1. Run `python launcher.py`
2. Navigate to the Admin, Zones, or Health tabs
3. All features from the cloud dashboard are available locally

## Development

The launcher is built with:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **tkinter** - GUI framework
- **ttk** - Themed widgets
- **requests** - API communication

To modify the dashboard:
1. Edit `launcher.py`
2. Update tab layout in `setup_<tab>_tab()` methods
3. Refresh data methods: `refresh_<resource>()`
4. UI update methods: `update_<resource>_ui()`
