# QuoTrading AI - Unified Admin & Trade Copy Dashboard

This is the **unified dashboard** that combines admin functionality with trade copy monitoring in a single local GUI application. **All data is fetched from your cloud server** - this is just a local interface to manage your cloud-based trading system.

## Features

### 📡 Trade Copy Tab
- **Real-time follower monitoring** - See all connected followers
- **Position tracking** - Monitor each follower's current positions
- **Signal statistics** - View signals executed vs received
- **Copy control** - Enable/disable signal broadcasting globally
- **Ultra-fast monitoring** - 100ms position polling for instant signal delivery

### 👥 Admin Tab
- **User management** - View all registered users from cloud server (Active, Suspended, Expired)
- **License operations**:
  - Suspend users
  - Activate users
  - Extend licenses (30 days)
- **User statistics** - Total users, active count, suspended count
- **Double-click actions** - Quick access to user operations

### 💚 Health Tab
- **System health monitoring**:
  - Flask Server status
  - PostgreSQL Database connection
  - Email Service availability
  - Whop API connectivity
- **Response times** - Monitor API latency
- **Overall health status** - Healthy, Degraded, or Unhealthy
- **Error details** - Troubleshoot issues quickly

## How to Run

1. **Configure your broker credentials** (first time only):
   ```bash
   cd trade-copier/master
   python launcher.py
   ```
   The GUI will prompt you to enter:
   - Broker username/email
   - API token

2. **Launch the dashboard**:
   ```bash
   python launcher.py
   ```

## Configuration

The launcher automatically generates a `config.json` file with your settings:
```json
{
  "api_url": "https://quotrading-flask-api.azurewebsites.net",
  "master_key": "<auto-generated>",
  "account_type": "Prop Firm",
  "broker_name": "TopStep",
  "broker": {
    "username": "your_email@gmail.com",
    "api_token": "your_api_token"
  }
}
```

**Note**: The `master_key` is automatically generated from your broker credentials for API authentication. You don't need to manually configure it.

## Cloud Server Connection

**Important**: This dashboard is a **local GUI interface** that connects to your **cloud server** at `https://quotrading-flask-api.azurewebsites.net`. 

- All user data is fetched from your cloud database
- All admin operations (suspend, activate, extend) are performed on the cloud server
- Trade signals are broadcast through the cloud API
- System health monitoring checks your cloud services

This is **NOT** a standalone application - it requires your cloud server to be running and accessible.

## Features Previously in Cloud Admin Dashboard

All features from the cloud-based admin dashboard (`cloud-api/flask-api/admin-dashboard-full.html`) are now available in this local GUI:

- ✅ User management (suspend, activate, extend) - operates on cloud database
- ✅ System health checks - monitors cloud services
- ✅ Trade copy monitoring - tracks cloud-connected followers
- ✅ Live follower tracking - real-time data from cloud

## Benefits of Unified Dashboard

1. **Single Application** - No need to open web browser for admin tasks
2. **Faster Access** - Local GUI with cloud data
3. **Integrated Workflow** - Manage users and monitor trades in one place
4. **Better UX** - Native desktop interface
5. **Still Cloud-Connected** - All data from your cloud server

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab Navigation** - Switch between tabs
- **F5** - Refresh current view
- **Ctrl+Q** - Quit application

## Troubleshooting

### Can't see admin features?
- Ensure you have valid admin credentials configured
- The `master_key` in config.json must be valid
- Verify internet connection to cloud server

### Can't see users?
- Check internet connection
- Verify cloud API server is running at https://quotrading-flask-api.azurewebsites.net
- Ensure `master_key` has admin permissions

### Health tab shows unhealthy services?
- Verify internet connection
- Check API server is running on cloud
- Ensure database credentials are correct on cloud server

## Migration from Cloud Admin Dashboard

The cloud admin dashboard at `/admin-dashboard-full.html` is deprecated in favor of this unified local dashboard. All functionality has been migrated to this local GUI application.

To use this instead of the cloud dashboard:
1. Run `python launcher.py`
2. Navigate to the Admin, Zones, or Health tabs
3. All features from the cloud dashboard are available locally

## Development

The launcher is built with:
- **Python 3.8+**
- **tkinter** - GUI framework
- **ttk** - Themed widgets
- **requests** - API communication

To modify the dashboard:
1. Edit `launcher.py`
2. Update tab layout in `setup_<tab>_tab()` methods
3. Refresh data methods: `refresh_<resource>()`
4. UI update methods: `update_<resource>_ui()`
